# Community Ecosystem Map 🌍

### Why? 🤔

The Community Ecosystem Map 🗺️ is a tool for all the people out there looking for meaningful relationships 💞 and real community 🤗. For everyone who desires to reconnect with the ecosystem 🌱 and socio-sphere around them and who wants to step out of their bubble 🏠 to find like-minded people, projects, and places. 

### How? 🛠️

This map is a tool for collaborative mapping 🤝. It makes local initiatives, people, and events visible 🌟 and enables real-life decentralized networking 🕸️. It's also an invitation to reconnect with our environment 🌳 and the community around us to actively shape our collective future 🚀 and start growing a decentralized network of people, projects, and events all over the world 🌐, starting in our local neighborhood. In this way, it can also become the bridge 🌉 between virtual Web3 solutions and true physical reality.

### What? 🌈

It does so by providing a geographic map web application that shows all items and allows the user to sign up and add projects, events, and their personal profile to the map 📍.

This map is showing the moos ecosystem using the [Utopia-UI](https://github.com/utopia-os/utopia-ui) Components 🛠️.

### Implementation 🏗️

The map is visualizing the ecosystem within and around the Moos community, using the building blocks of the [Utopia UI Framework](https://github.com/utopia-os/utopia-ui). During the Code 2 Community Hackathon, I extended the capabilities of that framework to make the manifold relations between projects, events, and community members visible 🌟 and to include also projects without a specific geographic location 🗺️.

Being present during the Hackathon at Moos, there was a close interaction with other teams 🤝. The [Moos Knowledge Garden Team]() provided a valuable dataset, which was imported with the help of the [Obsidian Node Canvas]() project, which also found ways to enrich the map with crawled web data and the help of vector embedding.

### Run the code 💻

Clone repository and ...

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Let's start mapping and growing our community ecosystem together! 🌱🌐
