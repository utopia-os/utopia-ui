              Like a role-playing game, you can create your own profile, but here you can map, share and train real skills.

            <li>            
              Further, real resources are made visible and available, managed and used, similar to a strategy game.

            <li>            
              Project management tasks can be mapped as quests, levels, missions and problems become challenges.

              <h3 className="text-base my-3 font-medium">  Permanent Structures</h3>

              When we play, we create tangible structures like places and infrastructure.

              And also intangibles like networks of relationships, stories, information ...

          Gameplay   </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">

          Through playful elements and gamification, the player is motivated and guided through  quests and levels.

          <h3 className="text-base my-3 font-medium">  Player Profiles</h3>

          The player examines himself and his abilities as well as deeper desires and visions to define his character or player profile.

          The focus is on the following questions:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 pt-4">
            <li>How and in what kind of world do I want to live?</li>
            <li>Who am I and what are my special abilities or my special task in this life?</li>
            <li>What do I have to give? What can and do I want to share with others and the world?</li>
            <li>What do I still need to come fully into my power? How can others support me in this?</li>
          </ul>




          <h3 className="text-base my-3 font-medium"> Resources</h3>
          The player explores and defines his/her offers and needs, shares his/her resources and uses those of the network.

          E.g. tools, machines, electrical appliances, vehicles, food and drink, places to sleep, rides, books, access to the internet, individual skills and help in everyday life
          <h3 className="text-base my-3 font-medium"> Realising Projects</h3>

          The player joins projects and starts his own.

          The game offers support in project management or crowdfunding.

          In this way, structures, events, permanent places, infrastructure and everything we need to meet our human needs in harmony with Mother Earth can be created.
          <h3 className="text-base my-3 font-medium"> Making Change visible</h3>

          The player is motivated to map and document the newly emerging world by ...
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 pt-4">

            <li>adding places, events etc. to the map</li>

            <li>documenting projects with text, images, audio and video</li>

            <li>telling stories of change</li>

              When we meet people in real life, we can exchange our public keys by scanning each other's QR codes or on paper.            </div>

            <div className="basis-full md:basis-1/2 pr-4 pb-4">
